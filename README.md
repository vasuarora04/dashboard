Code Review
Strengths:
•	 Component Structure: Components are well-separated (LoginPage, SignUpPage, Dashboard), which supports scalability.
•	 React Router Integration: Route-based navigation is clean and easy to follow.
•	 Styling: You've applied consistent styling via App.css.
Suggestions:
1.	Separate Demo Data:
o	Move demoUser, demoTasks, and demoStats to a separate file like src/data/demoData.js.
o	This keeps the App.jsx clean and promotes reusability.
2.	Authentication Logic:
o	Currently, any credentials lead to the dashboard. For better UX, simulate login validation and protect the /dashboard route from direct access.
3.	Dynamic Dashboard:
o	While some dynamic data is shown, you could further enhance it by:
	Showing task completion checkboxes.
	Displaying a real-time clock or notifications.
	Adding a logout button that redirects to login.
4.	Code Reusability:
o	Create small components inside the dashboard like <UserProfile />, <TaskList />, and <StatsCard />.
